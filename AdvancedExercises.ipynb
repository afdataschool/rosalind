    "Probability is the mathematical study of randomly occurring phenomena. We will model such a phenomenon with a random variable, which is simply a variable that can take a number of different distinct outcomes depending on the result of an underlying random process.\n",

    "For example, say that we have a bag containing 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. If we let $X$ represent the random variable corresponding to the color of a drawn ball, then the probability of each of the two outcomes is given by $Pr(X=red)=35$ and $Pr(X=blue)=25$.\n",

The probability of $Y$ being red depends on whether the first ball was red or blue. To represent all outcomes of $X$ and $Y$, we therefore use a probability tree diagram. This branching diagram represents all possible individual probabilities for $X$ and $Y$, with outcomes at the endpoints (\"leaves\") of the tree. The probability of any outcome is given by the product of probabilities along the path from the beginning of the tree.\n",

    "In 1202, Leonardo of Pisa (commonly known as Fibonacci) considered a mathematical exercise regarding the reproduction of a population of rabbits. He made the following simplifying assumptions about the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The population begins in the first month with a pair of newborn rabbits.\n",
    "* Rabbits reach reproductive age after one month.\n",
    "* In any given month, every rabbit of reproductive age mates with another rabbit of reproductive age.\n",
    "* Exactly one month after two rabbits mate, they produce one male and one female rabbit.\n",
    "* Rabbits never die or stop reproducing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci's exercise was to calculate how many pairs of rabbits would remain in one year. In the second month, the first pair of rabbits reach reproductive age and mate. In the third month, another pair of rabbits is born, and we have two rabbit pairs; our first pair of rabbits mates again. In the fourth month, another pair of rabbits is born to the original pair, while the second pair reach maturity and mate (with three total pairs). Have a go at drawing this problem for several months! After a year, the rabbit population boasts 144 pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Fibonacci's assumption of the rabbits' immortality may seem a bit farfetched, his model was not unrealistic for reproduction in a predator-free environment: European rabbits were introduced to Australia in the mid 19th Century, a place with no real indigenous predators for them. Within 50 years, the rabbits had already eradicated many plant species across the continent, leading to irreversible changes in the Australian ecosystem and turning much of its grasslands into eroded, practically uninhabitable parts of the modern Outback. In this problem, we will use the simple idea of counting rabbits to introduce a new computational topic, which involves building up large solutions from smaller ones."

    "A recurrence relation is a way of defining the terms of a sequence with respect to the values of previous terms. In the case of Fibonacci's rabbits from the introduction, any given month will contain the rabbits that were alive the previous month, plus any new offspring. A key observation is that the number of offspring in any month is equal to the number of rabbits that were alive two months prior. As a result, if $F_{n}$ represents the number of rabbit pairs alive after the n-th month, then we obtain the Fibonacci sequence having terms Fn that are defined by the recurrence relation $F_{n}=F_{n}−1+F_{n}−2$ (with $F_{1}=F_{2}=1$ to initiate the sequence). Although the sequence bears Fibonacci's name, it was known to Indian mathematicians over two millennia ago.\n",
